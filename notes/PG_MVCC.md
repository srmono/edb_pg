PostgreSQL utilizes a concurrency control mechanism known as Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) to manage concurrent access to data. Unlike traditional database systems that rely on locking, MVCC creates a different approach.

Here's a breakdown of how MVCC works in Postgres:

* **Transaction IDs (XIDs):** Each transaction in Postgres is assigned a unique identifier, the XID. This applies to single-statement transactions (like an UPDATE) and those wrapped in a BEGIN-COMMIT block.

* **Snapshot Isolation:** Every transaction operates on a consistent snapshot of the database at a specific point in time. This snapshot is essentially a read-only view of the data as it existed when the transaction began.

* **Data Versions with xmin and xmax:** Postgres stores additional information alongside each data row. These include:
    * xmin (transaction minimum): Represents the XID of the first transaction that needs the row to be visible.
    * xmax (transaction maximum): Represents the XID of the transaction that has made the latest update to the row (or is marked for deletion).

* **Visibility of Rows:** When a transaction reads a row, Postgres checks the xmin and xmax of the row against the transaction's own XID.
    * If the transaction's XID is less than the row's xmin (meaning the transaction started before the row was created), the row is not visible.
    * If the transaction's XID is greater than the row's xmax (meaning the transaction started after the row was deleted), the row is also not visible.
    * In any other case, the row is visible to the transaction.

**Benefits of MVCC:**

* **Reduced Lock Contention:** By avoiding explicit locks, MVCC enables concurrent reads and writes without blocking each other. This improves overall database performance, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.

* **Serializable Transactions:** Even with MVCC, Postgres upholds transaction isolation through a concept called Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). This ensures that transactions appear to run one after another, maintaining data consistency.

Understanding MVCC is crucial for developers and database administrators working with PostgreSQL, particularly when designing applications for high concurrency.
