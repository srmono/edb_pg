EnterpriseDB (EDB) offers two primary products: EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) and EDB Postgres Distributed (previously known as EDB Ark or EDB Postgres Platform for Kubernetes). Here's a detailed comparison of these two products, formatted as a Markdown file:

# EDB Postgres Advanced Server vs. EDB Postgres Distributed

## Overview

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
- **Description**: EPAS is an enhanced version of PostgreSQL with added features and tools designed for enterprise use. It includes performance enhancements, security features, Oracle compatibility, and advanced management tools.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for enterprises looking for a powerful, secure, and Oracle-compatible database solution with comprehensive management tools.

### EDB Postgres Distributed (EPD)
- **Description**: EDB Postgres Distributed (formerly known as EDB Ark or EDB Postgres Platform for Kubernetes) is designed for high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery. It provides a distributed PostgreSQL solution with built-in clustering, sharding, and multi-master replication capabilities.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications requiring high availability, distributed architecture, and seamless scalability across multiple nodes or geographical locations.

EDB stands for EnterpriseDB, a company that offers various database-related products and services. EDB BigAnimal, on the other hand, is a specific service provided by EDB. Here's a breakdown of the two:

**EDB (EnterpriseDB)**

* A company specializing in PostgreSQL technology.
* Offers a range of products and services, including:
    * Enterprise-grade PostgreSQL distributions
    * Database management tools
    * Consulting and support services

**EDB BigAnimal**

* A fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offered by EDB.
* Built on PostgreSQL technology.
* Key features include:
    * Easy setup, management, and scaling of PostgreSQL databases.
    * Deployment options in your cloud account or BigAnimal's cloud account.
    * Choice between PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server with Oracle compatibility.
    * High availability and scalability options.

**In simpler terms:**

* EDB is the company that builds the car (PostgreSQL expertise).
* EDB BigAnimal is a service where they manage the car for you (fully managed PostgreSQL in the cloud).

So, EDB BigAnimal is a specific type of service offered by the larger company EDB.
